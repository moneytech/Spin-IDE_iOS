//  SimpleIDE
//
//	This is the main view controller for the XBee/Propeller file loader. You can use this
//	view directly as the main view of a popover view controller, subclass it with your own
//	view controller to use it as part of your interface, or copy the contents into your
//	own class.
//
//	If you decide to subclass or adapt this view, include the componenets found in
//	LoadImageViewController.xib in your own nib file or storyboard.
//
//	This class also brings up the ConfigurationViewController in response to a user tap on
//	the Configure button. As designed, this brings up another popover. It is easy enough
//	rework the transition for iPhone navigation views or segues. See the configureButton
//	method.
